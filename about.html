			<p class="text-justify">Tap Social Movement was founded in 2016 by Paul, Amy and Tess. Having experience in a range of positions across the criminal justice system, we have all witnessed the difficulty people face when trying to turn their lives around after coming into contact with the law. There is a lack of support and assistance available to navigate complicated career pathways, and criminal records often dissuade employers from hiring otherwise eligible candidates. Many of the people we have worked with, especially those who have spent time in prison, struggle to access education, training and employment, hindering their rehabilitation, and drawing them back into a life of crime. But having worked closely with so many people who have been through the system we know that there is so much talent and potential that is going to waste. Tap Social Movement Ltd. was founded in an attempt to stop this vicious cycle by providing opportunities which set people up for long-term fulfilling employment.</p>
			<p class="text-justify">Whilst we all have different experience and qualifications (Paul is an independent criminal barrister and university tutor; Amy is currently undertaking doctoral research in criminology and Tess is a bachelor of commerce grad with craft beer bar and retail management experience), we share a passion for community and wanted to create a space where people from all walks of life come together to share skills and talent, exchange ideas and experiences and create new opportunity, particularly for those people who have had contact with the criminal justice system. We all had a keen interest in craft beer and had been doing some homebrewing, and with Tess’s industry knowledge, we realised that the rapidly growing craft beer industry presented a really exciting opportunity to create something huge. This is because craft beer is a young, social and vibrant industry in which people are proud to be involved; it involves practical but skilled work; and it requires technical, transferable and highly marketable skills. Speaking to as many breweries as we could confirmed our idea:  brewers are the most helpful, open-minded and awesome people and we couldn’t imagine a better environment to begin breaking down barriers and creating something new and exciting. When we first contacted the prisons, we were surprised by how receptive they were to the idea – there is a real need for new employment and training opportunities for people who are in custody.</p>
			<p class="text-justify">And some way into our planning stages we were joined by Jason, an award-winning brewer from the US and Matt, an economist with an interest in coding. And off we went! We bought our brewery, got a premises in an amazing location and Jason started developing killer recipes. We have developed our brand around prisoner artwork, all illustrations are produced by the boys at Young Offender Institution Cookham Wood. We will offer work experience and training on our workstreams in brewing, artwork and branding, sales and marketing and packaging and distribution, and offer recognised qualifications through partnerships with colleges.</p>
			<p class="text-justify">We are now in the process of setting up our taproom community space, where locals will be able to come together and sample our beers, enjoy live music, have brewery tours and even produce their own beer on our smaller kits.</p>
			<p class="text-justify">Come down and visit us and try our criminally good beer…</p>
